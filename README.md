# Coding Assignment 7

This project is an interactive eyes animation built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The eyes follow the mouse cursor, creating a dynamic and engaging visual effect.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The eyes adjust their behavior based on mouse movement.
- **Real-time Interaction**: The eyeballs track the position of the cursor as it moves around the screen.
- **Simple and Elegant**: Designed with minimalistic code using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the page
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout
- **JavaScript**: Handling the mousemove event for interactivity

## How It Works

The project consists of two main sections:
1. **HTML**: Defines the structure of the eyes and pupils.
2. **CSS**: Styles the elements, including the background, eye shape, and pupils.
3. **JavaScript**: Tracks the mouse movements and adjusts the position of the pupils based on cursor location.
